I already told you that in the Standalone Equipment tab, when I click the Add Equipment button, the sub-form should not open Instead, I need a form exactly like the Add Project form UI I’ve repeated this many times, but you still didn’t get it Even now, when I click that button, the same old sub-form is opening

everything is perfect, but the part shown in the screenshot needs to look exactly like it does in the Add New Project form when I select the equipment type, why is it showing those 6 fields (MSN, Job, Tag, Technical Specifications, Docs, etc.) immediately below? I need it exactly the same way it appears in the Add Project form The rest is perfect, so don’t change anything else...

plz remove Project Manager input 
Okay,now I need this fully working so check my current schema and then tell me what changes are required

Remove the Working Pressure, Design Temperature, Supervisor, and Location Details fields from the Standalone Equipment page. And under Team Member, only show the Equipment Manager — nothing else

For Standalone Equipment, the logs should work exactly like they do in Project Equipment, but with separate files for Standalone. Every change, update, or addition should be visible in the logs, just like Project Equipment. And the existing functionality should not be affected — only the required changes should be done

Do we need to create anything in Supabase for this? Because the logs are still not showing Wait, don’t use the equipment_logs table for Standalone Equipment need to create a new table specifically for Standalone Equipment logs

The setting section for Standalone Equipment should also work properly, the same way it works for Projects check what needs to be set up for this and fix it and remember, all of this will have separate files specifically for Standalone Equipment

In the Add Equipment form, when I add an Equipment Manager, that member should appear in the Settings tab of the Standalone Equipment card when I click the View button. Along with that, the member should also be visible in the Team tab of the Standalone Equipment card with their position just like it works in the Project Equipment card Team tab
